# Semantic Scene Modeling Tasks

## Source Specifications

These tasks are derived from:

- [Semantic Scene Modeling HLD](../../hlds/hld-semantic-scene-modeling.md)
- [PRD: Semantic Scene Modeling](../../prds/prd-semantic-scene-modeling.md)

## Task Set Intent

This task set covers the first semantic capability slice, the contract-direction spike that followed it, and the current follow-on shells derived from the updated PRD, HLD, and the latest iteration-planning review.

The current task set persists the completed first-wave semantic work and the next chosen follow-on shells:

- semantic core plus the first `create_site_element` vertical slice
- completion of the remaining first-wave semantic creation vocabulary
- explicit metadata mutation for Managed Scene Objects
- alignment of shipped `tree_proxy` geometry with the accepted volumetric baseline captured during validation
- validation of the exploratory semantic `v2` contract direction through a minimal Ruby normalizer spike
- public `create_site_element` contract cutover to the sectioned create shape plus builder-native migration for `path` and `structure`
- limited hierarchy-maintenance primitives for managed-object organization and repair
- builder-native migration for the remaining first-wave semantic families
- lifecycle primitives needed to make richer built-form authoring materially real
- richer built-form and composed-feature authoring inside the current semantic product boundary
- managed-object maintenance alignment for post-create semantic revision behavior
- horizontal-cross-section terrain-drape realization for hosted semantic paths
- governed duplication and managed deletion policy
- terrain-sampled planting-mass `proxy_mass` representation quality for early-design planting proxies
- terrain-clamped semantic linear edges and canonical `edge_restraint` vocabulary for curb and restraint workflows

## Deferred Follow-Ons

The following follow-ons remain intentionally deferred from the active task folders:

- promote next-wave semantic element types such as `tree_instance`, `seat`, `water_feature_proxy`, and possibly `terrain_patch`

## Notes

- `SEM-03` is explicitly blocked by `STI-01` because semantic metadata mutation must reuse the delivered targeting contract rather than introduce a semantic-side lookup subsystem.
- Contract updates are embedded into each active task that changes the public Python/Ruby tool surface. There is no standalone semantic contract task.
- The active set is intentionally narrower than the full PRD. It proves the semantic capability in three core slices before expanding into rebuild, compatibility, or next-wave semantic work.
- `SEM-04` is a refinement follow-up created after live geometry review. It preserves the existing semantic contract while capturing a stricter accepted baseline for `tree_proxy` output.
- `SEM-05` is a validation spike task. It does not adopt the exploratory `v2` contract direction by itself; it exists to prove or falsify that direction through the smallest practical Ruby-owned normalization slice before any future contract decision.
- `SEM-06` is the authoritative contract-cutover task for semantic creation. It removes the dual public create posture and makes the sectioned contract the single `create_site_element` baseline while migrating `path` and `structure` to builder-native sectioned input.
- `SEM-07` remains separate from contract migration. It carries only the limited hierarchy-maintenance posture introduced after the lifecycle gap review.
- `SEM-08` completes the remaining first-wave family migration under the sectioned create-contract baseline by covering `pad`, `retaining_edge`, `planting_mass`, and `tree_proxy`.
- `SEM-09` deliberately narrows the earlier lifecycle-hardening idea to the primitives needed for richer built-form authoring. It is not a full terrain or broad maintenance task.
- `SEM-10` captures the next richer authoring slice inside the current semantic PRD boundary. Terrain authoring remains out of scope for the active set.
- `SEM-11` and `SEM-12` move managed-object maintenance, duplication, and deletion policy after the richer built-form authoring slice instead of forcing all hardening work to land first.
- `SEM-10` and `SEM-11` are now completed and live-validated against SketchUp-hosted hierarchy and managed-maintenance flows.
- `SEM-12` remains the next draft follow-on for governed duplication and managed deletion policy.
- `SEM-13` is now completed and live-validated: `path + surface_drape` builds a smoothed terrain-following top ribbon with horizontal cross-sections, coherent downward thickness shell output, and structured refusals.
- `SEM-14` is the current create-contract hardening follow-on. It keeps one canonical sectioned `create_site_element` surface while addressing bounded malformed request-shape recovery and family-specific `definition` boundary drift at the MCP seam.
- `SEM-16` is a planned follow-on for the live `planting_mass + representation.mode: "proxy_mass"` gap. It uses `procedural_terrain_planting_mass.rb` as prototype evidence for terrain-sampled procedural planting output, reuses existing scene-query/profile sampling and staged-asset surface-frame logic, and adds a generated-component seam that also componentizes the accepted tree proxy without changing its visual contract. It does not add public procedural controls, add next-wave semantic families, or implement staged-asset replacement.
- `SEM-17` captures the hosted linear-edge gap reported during terrain path authoring: `retaining_edge + edge_clamp` is currently accepted but can still build planar z=0 geometry, while curb or sett restraint edges need one canonical semantic type. It fixes the retaining-edge hosted behavior, adds `edge_restraint` without synonym aliases, and uses existing `surfaceOffset` validation as the post-create terrain-proximity acceptance mechanism without turning semantic hardscape into terrain source state.
